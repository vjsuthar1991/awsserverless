# Description
This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for a production-level NodeJS microservice project designed for an e-commerce website, covering both backend and frontend development. The project is built using serverless technology, following best practices such as the SOLID principles, CQRS design pattern, and clean architecture. Every coding step and concept is self-explanatory, making it easy for you to follow along and gain a deep understanding of how to develop, deploy, and manage a microservice in a real-world scenario.

# Features
Serverless Architecture: Utilize AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and other serverless services to create a scalable and cost-effective application.
Infrastructure as Code: Define and deploy your infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation and the AWS CDK.
SOLID Principles: Write maintainable and scalable code by adhering to SOLID principles.
CQRS Design Pattern: Implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read and write operations.
Clean Architecture: Ensure a clean and modular architecture that promotes separation of concerns and ease of testing.
Production-Ready: Learn how to handle deployment, monitoring, and scaling in a production environment.
